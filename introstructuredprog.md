## What is "programming paradigm"? <h2>
A programming paradigm is the style in which someone programs, they serve as a way to classify programming languages based on their features. They are separated in two main cathegories: Imperative and Declarative.  <br>
**Imperative:**  <br>
It uses statements that change a program's state and expresses commands for the computer to perform; imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.  <br>
**Declarative:**  <br>
Expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. Declarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed.  <br>  <br>
