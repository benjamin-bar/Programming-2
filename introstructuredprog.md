## What is "programming paradigm"? <h1>
A programming paradigm is the style in which someone programs, they serve as a way to classify programming languages based on their features. They are separated in two main cathegories: Iperative and Declarative.  <br>
**Imperative:**  <br>
It uses statements that change a program's state and expresses commands for the computer to perform; imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.  <br>
**Declarative:**  <br>
